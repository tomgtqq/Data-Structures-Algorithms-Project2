Analyze:
I need to find a recursion solution with a cache to solve the problem.
Subtask:
- Design recursion solution to check all groups
- Define a cache to store the check result

The function **is_user_in_group_recursion** takes O(n) time complexity, I think the "for loop" is O(n) and "recursion solution"is O(log(n)).The time complexity isn't O(nlog(n))

I think it's linear space complexity O(n) , beacues 2 list(),1 dict() is scalable
