Analyze:
I need to find a recursion solution to solve the problem . so I need to solve smaller instances of the same problem. if there is one file in the folder. I need to find that file with a given "suffix" and return it. if there is one folder in the folder. I need to involve calling the function from within itself and wait to get "output" until searching all folders and return all the results.

Subtask:

1.find where invoking function
2.define base case

For the space complexity, in the worst-case scenario, all the files in all the directories will match inputting suffix and we will have to save them so the complexity will be O(N*M). where N is the number of directories in the path and M the number of files in the directories.

For the time complexity, because how long the code will take to run would depend on how many directories and how many files have to be visited as well. so It's O(N*M).
